## 1.circRNA-Disease association

We infer circRNA functional similarity by measuring the similarity of their associated disease DAG.

## 2.circRNA-GO association

we constructed 230,699 corpus, with 50. 409 categories, using the Skip-gram model in word2vec. Some of the codes we used refer to the following articleï¼š

## 3.circRNA sequence information

We applied chaos game representation to get functional similarity of circRNAs.
